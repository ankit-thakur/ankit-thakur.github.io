				<p><strong>Lead Programmer</strong> Lead in a team oriented engineering design course in which an interdisciplinary team of 8 	engineers collaborated to create an over-sand vehicle that self-navigated an obstacle course and took various measurements resulting in 2nd place in a class competition.  I learned to work with Arduino products and code using C.  I learned to bridge the gap between machines and programming to make the two work in unison.<br><br>
				<strong>Tutor</strong> Worked as a tutor with a company called Coder Kids.  The goal was to get young kids interested in coding by teaching them the basics of programming using fun applications such as Scratch, Java with Minecraft, Python with Minecraft, and Roblox Studio.  I gained a strong foundation in the fundamentals of programming through teaching as well as a good handle on working with children.<br><br>
				<strong>Intern for a Day</strong> Spent the day at KnucklePuck Digital Media Consulting, a digital marketing company that specializes in Search Engine Optimization(SEO).  I learned much about the importance of SEO in web development and digital marketing.
